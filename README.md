Numbers:

Numbers can be convented from a String using parseInt(), but if you want to output a number that always uses base 10, then parseFloat() is the way to go as it always uses base 10.

NaN means not a number

parseFloat("10.2abc") will output 10.2 because it stops after a non number is introduced

Strings

'supercalifragilistcexpialidocious'.length //33

'supercalifragilistcexpialidocious'.charAt(0); // "s"
means the first character of hello is 's'
